### Heart Health Experimental Analysis
## Overview
This project contains an experimental dataset used for analyzing heart health metrics. The goal is to explore the relationship between physiological data (like blood pressure and BMI) and health indications.
## Data Sheet Details
The file `Health_heart_experimental.csv` contains records with the following Attributes:-
* age
* sex (gender-0 or 1)
* sysBP (systolic blood pressure)
* diaBP (diastolic blood pressure)
* HR (heart rate)
* Weight-KG
* Height-CM
* BMI (Mass index)
* indication (health risk incicator)

# Line chart
    - Line chart shows trends or changes over continious interval.
        x-axis shows the progresssion-time  
        y-axis shows the numeric value or the quantity.

# Bar plot
    - Bar plot is a visualization in the for of rectangular bars that compare distinct groups withs its numeric value.
        x-axis shows the any categories, labels, groups.
        y-axis shows the numeric values generally quantity.

# Pie chart
    - Pie chart represents data as slices of a circle to show proportions or percentages of a whole.
        each slice shows how much a category contributes to the total.
        it is useful when comparing parts of a **single dataset rather than changes over time**.

# Box plot
- Box plot displays the distribution of numerical data.
  - it shows the minimum, first quartile (Q1), median (Q2), third quartile (Q3), and maximum.
  - the box represents the interquartile range (IQR), covering the middle 50% of the data.
  - whiskers extend to the minimum and maximum values, excluding outliers.
  - outliers are shown as individual points beyond the whiskers.
  - it helps visualize **central tendency, spread, skewness, and outliers**, and is useful for comparing multiple groups.

# Histogram
- Histogram visualizes the distribution of numerical data by grouping it into **bins** (continuous intervals) and showing the frequency of 
    data points in each bin.
  - the x-axis represents the range of data divided into bins.
  - the y-axis shows the frequency (count) of data points in each bin.
  - bars are adjacent, with height indicating frequency, making it easy to see **data concentration, spread, and skewness**.
  - unlike a bar chart, which compares distinct categories, histograms are used for **continuous data** and help identify patterns, outliers, and overall distribution.
  - common uses include **statistical analysis, quality control, and data exploration**.
  
# Scatter Plot
- Scatter plot displays the relationship between two numerical variables.
  - x-axis represents one variable (e.g., BMI)
  - y-axis represents another variable (e.g., heart rate)
  - each point represents an individual data record
  - helps identify **correlations, patterns, clusters, and outliers**
  - different colors or markers can represent categories (e.g., indication status)
  - useful for exploring relationships and making predictions
  - example: BMI vs heart rate showing clear separation between healthy individuals (lower BMI) and those with heart disease (higher BMI)

# Key Findings
1. **BMI and Heart Disease**: Strong correlation observed between higher BMI values (>30) and positive indication of heart disease
2. **Heart Rate Variability**: Heart rate alone does not strongly discriminate between healthy and diseased groups, with both showing similar distributions
3. **Age-Specific Patterns**: At age 40, individuals with heart disease predominantly have BMI values above 30, while healthy individuals cluster in the 17-30 range
4. **Population Risk**: The high prevalence of obesity and overweight status suggests this is a high-risk population for cardiovascular complications

# Usage
This dataset can be used for:
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Predictive modeling for heart disease
- Statistical analysis of cardiovascular risk factors
- Data visualization practice
- Machine learning classification tasks

# Requirements
- Python 3.x
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- numpy
